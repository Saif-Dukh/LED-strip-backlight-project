## Description

This project, designed as part of the Electronics-ICT course, addresses the challenge of eye strain and headaches Milan faces due to poor lighting conditions behind his computer screens. The solution proposed is the implementation of an LED strip behind the computer screens, which is already built into the desk, requiring only the power supply to be concealed with a specially designed holder.
